About

> data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the
> trailers.

This project ([Movie Trailer Website](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004))
is intended to demonstrate an understanding of core programming 
concepts, the Python programming language, and the typical role of a
web server (accept a request, execute code, and generate a response).

Please note that the scope of this project did not include persistent data
storage. In a real-world environment movies would be stored in a more suitable
way (e.g. database). Also, in a real-world setup templates would be used to
render HTML rather than manipulating HTML included in a Python module.

The `original_files` folder contains the files provided by Udacity for this
project, unchanged. Changes were made to conform to Python's standards and best
practices.
